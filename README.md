Project Title:
 Virtual University Tour Application
 
Introduction:
This project is a 3D virtual tour application that was created in Unity and is aimed at students, both current and potential ones, who for some reason or other cannot come to the university for a visit. By using this application, the users will have the opportunity to check out a lot of different buildings, classrooms, and common areas, where they will get plenty of precious information about the university's facilities and programs. The application's main targets are the following: improving the onboarding of new students and helping applicants find the way in the campus environment all that without physically visiting the university.

Problem Statement:
Most of the students who wish to move into new universities are not able to accomplish this process due the financial limitations, the distances, or the timetable conflicts. At the conventional virtual tours, there are usually presented only still images or videos that don't evoke the feeling of immersive or interactive and this is their main drawback. This is a reason why students are unable to take the tour of the campus, acknowledge the layout, and become emotionally attached to the university, at the end of the day, they are not engaged. This inactivity can lead to their making poor decisions which can result in their lack of confidence and satisfaction with the chosen institution. In response to this issue, there is a pressing need for a campus virtual tour that is easily accessible, realistic, and user-friendly, and which, at the same time, can virtualize a real-life experience and assist students in decision-making.

Access and Equity: The Problem Of Campus Tours As The Cause Of Restricted Campus Visitations The passage describes the multiple obstacles that are lying in the way of attending live campus tours that include money issues, when students cannot come at the appointed time and accessibility issues. It repeatedly points to the significance of equal access to learning and knowledge.


Enabling the Virtual Tour of a University Campus: The Experiment of the Tool and the User Favourable View of It This experiment is an inquiry report about the appropriateness of the virtual campus tour application to provide information and give new learners a view of the campus environment. The keynotes of virtual tours emphasize their usability and the users' feeling concerning them.


Virtual Campus Tour (Students' Perception of the University Virtual Environment): This research studies the attitudes of students viewing virtual campus tours and at the same time draws on the students' experiences to establish that the practice of virtual reality can really promote university campuses. It examines the students' reaction to the virtual tours and the potential of virtual reality applications to reinforce university campuses.


A 3D Interactive Virtual Tour for an Enjoyable Campus Visit Experience: This paper leads a walkthrough of the conception stage of a 3D virtual tour application that is both flesh and engaging and is used as a method of visually illustrating, informing and luring potential students to the school. It also takes into account various issues including cybersickness and less interactive technologies of the past in its attempt to solve them.


Augmented Reality Approach in Virtual Campus Tour Application:This entry introduces markerless augmented reality technology into the building of virtual university tours and they further unveil features and benefits of such applications besides discussing them in comparison so as to emphasize the advantage.

Objectives:
To get to the point where people enter a computer-generated 3D virtual reality tour of the university using Unity.
By extension, students who have not yet joined are also given the opportunity to view classrooms and facilities.
To animate the navigation menu for the visitor to be able to easily & fastly discover the different sections of the app as well as to turn off the animation.
To assist the arrival of new students by arranging the campus map for them before coming.
The aforementioned tree are all the good things about the school.
To make it unnecessary for people to go to the school in person, which will help them save their time and their travel costs.


Technology Stack:
Blender 4.3.
Unity 2022.
Visual Studio 2022, C#.
Autodesk Maya 2025.
Plastic SCM.

Installation Instructions:
Get the Application Files Follow the link to the official Google Drive folder and download the application files: Download Folder – Google Drive
Open the Executable File Once the folder is downloaded and extracted (if compressed), find VR Tour.exe file and double-click on it to open the application.
Start the Virtual Tour The moment the application is executed, it is full-fledged and in a state of complete readiness to communicate with the user. You can instantly get started with the university exploration of your liking.
Note: Apart from the Unity-base, there is no other installation requirement. Make sure that your device meets the minimum hardware requirements for the smooth running of the Unity-based applications.

Usage Guide:
Open a application.
In the main menu select and press the “Start” button.
Select the start location of your tour.
Now you are free to explore the university campus. 

Known Issues / Limitations
Challenges Faced and Overcome

Unity Developer:
One of the many obstructions was adjusting the player movement to be soft not only in the indoors but in the narrow region as well. I accomplished this by refining the character collider and increasing the camera sensitivity.
Additionally, it was a must to connect the scenes by properly linking them through UI. In order to do this, one needed to take care of the scene ID and also do the tests.
The problem was setting up collisions and colliders, and the player fell through the floor, and textures got stuck in each other.
During texturing of the building, it was found that due to time constraints and technical problems, textures could not be applied correctly, as it was impossible to paint objects separately by faces. It was decided not to use textures to avoid errors and problems.

The project uses the following open-source libraries:  

 Unity: 
[Burst Compiler](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/burst) – Optimized C# compilation.  
[PhysX](https://github.com/NVIDIAGameWorks/PhysX) – Physics simulation.

 Blender/Maya:
[OpenGL](https://www.opengl.org/) – Core graphics rendering.  
[GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) – Handles windows and user input.  
[Bullet Physics](https://pybullet.org/) – Real-time collision detection.  
[OpenSubdiv](https://github.com/PixarAnimationStudios/OpenSubdiv) – Subdivision surfaces.  

  Development Tools:  
[VS Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) (MIT) – Primary code editor.
